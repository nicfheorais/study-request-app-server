//  HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
//  this has been added to package.json as follows:
//           "dbpopulatebuddysearchestable": "node -r dotenv/config ./db/scripts/populateBuddySearchesTable.js",

//
//  therefore it can be run at the command prompt as follows:
//       $ npm run dbpopulatebuddysearchestable

import query from "../index.js";

// note: deliberately not inserting into date_posted or create_date_time as they have default of current date
//20Jan2022 - Need to NOT send in a value for id column, because it messes up the auto-increment for subsequent inserts.
